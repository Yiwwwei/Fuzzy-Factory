# Maven Fuzzy Factory - Advanced SQL Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository contains advanced SQL scripts used to analyze eCommerce business performance for Maven Fuzzy Factory. The analysis focuses on user traffic, bounce rates, A/B testing, and conversion funnels to provide actionable, data-driven insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Database Management:** MySQL
- **Tools:** SQL Workbench, MySQL Server

## 📁 Project Structure
```
📂 scripts
 ┣ 📄 traffic_analysis.sql           -- Analyzes page view sessions and entry pages
 ┣ 📄 bounce_rate_analysis.sql       -- Calculates bounce rates for landing pages
 ┣ 📄 conversion_funnels.sql         -- Builds and analyzes user conversion funnels
 ┗ 📄 ab_testing.sql                 -- Evaluates A/B testing for landing and billing pages

📄 README.md
```

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. **Traffic Analysis**:
   - Identified peak traffic pages and entry points.
2. **Bounce Rate Analysis**:
   - Measured bounce rates to optimize landing pages.
3. **Conversion Funnels**:
   - Tracked user paths through key pages to identify drop-off points.
4. **A/B Testing**:
   - Evaluated the performance of landing pages and billing page variants.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yi/Fuzzy-Factory.git
   ```
2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Load the `mavenfuzzyfactory` database schema and data.
   - Execute scripts in the `scripts/` folder as needed.

3. **Run SQL Scripts**:
   - Use any SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to run the scripts for analysis.

## 📝 Scripts Details
- `traffic_analysis.sql`:
  - Calculates page view sessions and identifies landing pages.
- `bounce_rate_analysis.sql`:
  - Creates bounce rate metrics for each landing page.
- `conversion_funnels.sql`:
  - Tracks user conversion funnels to measure engagement and drop-off.
- `ab_testing.sql`:
  - Compares the performance of two billing page variants.
